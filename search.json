    "section": "",
    "text": "Note: this is an abbreviated syllabus. The full syllabus is available through Classmate and/or Canvas.\n\nInstructor Information\n\nDr. Samantha Seals\nOffice: 4/344\n\n\n\nMeeting Times and Location\n\nMW 1:00 pm-2:15 pm in 79/171\nTR 9:30 am-10:45 am in 4/305\n\n\n\nOffice Hours\n\nMonday: 9:00 am-11:00 am\nTuesday: 2:00 pm-4:00 pm\nWednesday: 9:00 am-11:00 am\nOther times by appointment\n\n\n\nGrading and Evaluation\nThe course grade will be determined as follows:\n\nR labs (25%): Students will complete in-class activities using Quarto and R. The resulting .html file should be submitted to the designated Assignment on Canvas by 11:59 pm on the specified date (see Canvas calendar).\nWeekly quizzes (10%): Once a week, students will complete a brief quiz at the end of class. Quizzes cannot be taken early and missed quizzes cannot be made up. Of the 13 planned quizzes, the lowest 2 grades will be dropped.\nProjects (40%): Every module will finish with a project to demonstrate the knowledge gained. These will be like the R Labs, but putting everything in the module together. The resulting .html file should be submitted to the designated Assignment on Canvas by 11:59 pm on the specified date (see Canvas).\nFinal Exam (25%): The final exam will be a concepts-based written exam. While there may be some basic calculations needed, you will not be processing raw data.\n\nIt is expected that all work submitted is the student’s own work. Evidence of academic dishonesty, including use of “homework help” websites (e.g., Chegg) and copying other students’ work, will be submitted to the Dean of Students. A grade of 0 will automatically be assigned for the assignment and there will be no opportunities to change that grade. If there are repeated incidents, the sanctions attached will increase in severity, including an F in the course and suspension from the university.\nWhat about AI? Absolutely okay when it’s used as a learning tool. It can be helpful when you are stuck, when you want to check your own work, asking for additional examples, or alternative explanations to concepts. However, it is not okay to let AI complete assignments for you.\nHere’s how you can use AI responsibly:\n\nAsk it to explain concepts you don’t fully understand.\nHave it help debug your code and ask for help understanding R error messages.\nAsk it to provide additional examples, perhaps in an area you are interested in.\n\n\n\nLate Policy\nAll projects have due dates, however, the Assignments on Canvas will not close until the end of the semester. All students are automatically granted “extensions” without question.\nNote that if there is not a submission when I go to grade (after the initial deadline), I will assign a zero (0) and request that you submit the assignment when you are able to. This is only for record keeping purposes. There is no penalty for submitting late and a full grade will be given upon review of your submission.\nExtensions are not available for quizzes or the final exam. All work must be submitted by 8 am on December 14, 2025."

Note that the headers of slides often match language used in the assignments.\nHave you googled the error message you saw?\nHave you asked your classmates (& Dr. Seals) on Discord? Truly, others have the same question, I promise! Do not be afraid to share a screenshot of your code and any corresponding output or error message.\n\nWhy did I lose points?\n\nPlease check the rubric; I try to give enough feedback for you to determine how to fix your assignment.\nIf clarification is still needed, please do not hesitate to come see me during office hours.\n\nIs there tutoring?\n\nNo, there is no University-provided tutoring.\nHowever, my research students are great resources. Please reach out to me if you are interested in hiring one of my students for tutoring."
